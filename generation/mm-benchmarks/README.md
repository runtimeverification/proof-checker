# Metamath benchmark files

The following is a list of the Metamath benchmark files in the order of their complexity:

1. `impreflex.mm`: a proof of phi -> phi in MM formalization of matching logic
2. `perceptron.mm`: a proof of the execution goal for a perceptron over 5 fixed inputs implemented in IMP.
3. `svm5.mm`: a proof of the execution goal for a support vector machine over 5 fixed inputs implemented in IMP.
4. `transfer.mm`: a proof of the execution goal for a ERC20 like transfer function implemented in IMP.
5. `transfer5000.mm`: a proof of the execution goal for a batch of 50000 ERC20 like transfer functions implemented in IMP.
